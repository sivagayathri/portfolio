        <p>Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in New Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family.[13] His father, Prem Kohli,
            worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, is a homemaker.[14][15] He has an older brother,
            Vikash, and an older sister, Bhavna.[16]

            Kohli was raised in Uttam Nagar[17] and started his schooling at Vishal Bharti Public School.[14][18] In
            1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy was created and a nine-year-old Kohli was part of its first intake.[17]
            Kohli trained at the academy under Rajkumar Sharma[15] and also played matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy
            at Vasundhara Enclave at the same time.[17] In ninth grade, he shifted to Saviour Convent in Paschim Vihar
            to help his cricket practice.[14][19] His family lived in Meera Bagh until 2015 when they moved to
            Gurgaon.[20]

            Kohli's father died on 18 December 2006 due to a stroke after being bed-ridden for a month.[14]

            Delhi
            Kohli first played for Delhi Under-15 team in October 2002 in the 2002–03 Polly Umrigar Trophy. He became
            the captain of the team for the 2003–04 Polly Umrigar Trophy. In late 2004, he was selected in the Delhi
            Under-17 team for the 2003–04 Vijay Merchant Trophy. Delhi Under-17s won the 2004–05 Vijay Merchant Trophy
            in which Kohli finished as the highest run-scorer with 757 runs from 7 matches with two centuries.[21] In
            February 2006, he made his List A debut for Delhi against Services but did not get to bat.[22]

            Kohli made his first-class debut for Delhi against Tamil Nadu[23] in November 2006, at the age of 18, he
            scored 10 runs in his debut innings.[24] He came into the spotlight in December when he decided to play for
            his team against Karnataka on the day after his father's death and went on to score 90.[25] He went directly
            to the funeral after he got out in the match. He scored a total of 257 runs from 6 matches at an average of
            36.71 in that season.[26]

            India Under-19
            In July 2006, Kohli was selected in the India Under-19 squad on its tour of England. He averaged 105 in the
            three-match ODI series against England Under-19s[27] and 49 in the three-match Test series.[28] India
            Under-19 went on to win both the series. In September, the India Under-19 team toured Pakistan. Kohli
            averaged 58 in the Test series[29] and 41.66 in the ODI series against Pakistan Under-19s.[30]

            In April 2007, he made his Twenty20 debut[31] and finished as the highest run-getter for his team in the
            Inter-State T20 Championship with 179 runs at an average of 35.80.[32] In July–August 2007, the India
            Under-19 team toured Sri Lanka. In the triangular series against Sri Lanka Under-19s and Bangladesh
            Under-19s, Kohli was the second highest run-getter with 146 runs at an average of 29 from 5 matches.[33][34]
            In the two-match Test series that followed, he scored 244 runs at an average of 122 including a century and
            a fifty.[35]

            In February–March 2008, Kohli captained the victorious Indian team at the 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup
            held in Malaysia. Batting at number 3, he scored 235 runs in 6 matches at an average of 47 and finished as
            the tournament's third-highest run-getter and one of the three batsmen to score a hundred in the
            tournament.[36][37] He has helped India in a three-wicket semi-final win over New Zealand Under-19s by
            taking 2 wickets and scoring 43 runs in the run-chase and was awarded the man of the match.[38][39]

            In June 2008, Kohli and his Under-19 teammates Pradeep Sangwan and Tanmay Srivastava were awarded the
            Border-Gavaskar scholarship. The scholarship allowed the three players to train for six weeks at Cricket
            Australia's Centre of Excellence in Brisbane.[37] He was also picked in the India Emerging Players squad for
            the four-team Emerging Players Tournament and scored 206 runs in six matches at an average of 41.20.[40]

            Early international career
            In August 2008, Kohli was included in the Indian ODI squad for tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in
            Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had played only eight List A matches.[41] So, his selection
            was called a "surprise call-up".[42] During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin
            Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were injured, Kohli batted as a makeshift opener throughout the series.[43] He
            made his international debut, at the age of 19, in the first ODI of the tour and was dismissed for 12.[44]
            He made his first ODI half century, a score of 54, in the fourth match.[44]

           
            During tour of Australia in December 2011, Kohli failed to go past 25 in the first two Tests, as his
            defensive technique was exposed.[95] While fielding on the boundary during the second day of the second
            match, he gestured to the crowd with his middle finger for which he was fined 50% of his match fee by the
            match referee.[96] He top-scored in each of India's innings in the third Test at Perth, with 44 and 75, even
            as India got their second consecutive innings defeat.[97][98] In the fourth and final match at Adelaide,
            Kohli scored his maiden Test century of 116 runs in the first innings.[99] India suffered a 0–4 whitewash
            and Kohli, India's top run-scorer in the series, was described as "the lone bright spot in an otherwise
            nightmare visit for the tourists".[100]
